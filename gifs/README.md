## What It Is

Balancd is a privacy-first, AI-assisted bookkeeping desktop application built to compress the month-end close workflow that QuickBooks and Xero don't address — reconciliation, accruals, intercompany matches, journal entries, and close-the-books — into a single local-first platform. Accounting firms keep their data on-premises; Balancd gives them their nights back.

Built as a working architectural prototype, Balancd is currently in pre-seed capital formation under [Voss AI Consulting](https://www.vossaiconsulting.com).

## My Role

**Project Manager & Lead Developer** — year-long capstone, 477 total commits across the team.

I owned:
- Full-stack architecture design and implementation decisions
- Frontend (React/TypeScript) and backend (Rust/SQLite) development
- AI integration via the Anthropic Claude API
- Authentication systems (2FA with TOTP, bcrypt, AES-256-GCM encryption)
- Testing infrastructure — 130 passing tests across the stack
- All technical documentation, IEEE 830 SRS, and final delivery presentation

### Security & Multi-Tenancy
- Multi-tenant organization management — separate firm and client data
- Two-factor authentication (TOTP, RFC 6238 compliant)
- AES-256-GCM data encryption at rest
- Full audit trail on all financial operations
- Local-first architecture — client data never leaves the firm's perimeter

### AI Integration
- Anthropic Claude API for automated audit assistance

## Architecture Overview

Balancd uses **Tauri** as its desktop runtime, pairing a **Rust** backend with a **React/TypeScript** frontend. This local-first architecture is a deliberate design decision: by running natively on the firm's hardware, client financial data never has to leave the firm's perimeter to be processed — a structural privacy advantage over cloud-only competitors.

## What This Demonstrates

For recruiters and engineers reviewing this project:

- **Systems thinking** — local-first architecture with a clear rationale (data residency) not just framework preference
- **Security implementation** — real auth (TOTP, AES-256-GCM), not placeholder login screens
- **AI integration** — production-style Claude API usage with domain-specific prompting (accounting/audit context)
- **Full-stack ownership** — from PostgreSQL schema design to TypeScript UI to Rust command handlers
- **Project leadership** — PM role on a year-long, client-facing, multi-person engineering project
- **Testing discipline** — 130 passing tests, not "I tested it manually"
- **Domain fluency** — GAAP/IFRS, double-entry accounting, close workflow — learned and applied during the project
